            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I have an unorthodox educational background. I dropped out of high school when I turned 17, but I passed the Colorado GED test "college-ready" just two weeks later. 
                After working nearly full-time for six months, I made the decision to enroll in Arapahoe Community College, where I completed most of my core classes. </p>
            <p>I took a year-long break from college during the 2020 pandemic, and returned to college in Spring 2021 by transferring to Colorado State University. 
                Here, I was introduced to computer science through the Java programming language. I completed a number of introductory CS courses, in which I built solid foundations in both Java and Python. </p>
            <p>In Spring 2023, I moved back to my hometown and transferred to MSU Denver, where I earned a Bachelor of Science in statistics in Spring 2025. </p>
