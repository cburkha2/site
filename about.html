            <div class="heading">Summary</div>
            <p>I have several years of experience in both computer programming and data analysis. While I am most comfortable 
                with programming in R, I am also proficient in Python, Java, and C#. </p>
            <p>My experience with data analysis spans various disciplines, within both personal and academic settings. I have 
                trained machine learning models to forecast flight delays, home prices, and trading card game decks. </p>
                
            <div class="heading">Education</div>
            <p>I have an unorthodox educational background. I dropped out of high school shortly after I turned 17, but I 
                passed the Colorado GED test "college-ready" just two weeks later.
                After working nearly full-time for six months, I decided to enroll in Arapahoe Community College, where I 
                completed most of my core classes. </p>
            <p>After taking a year-long break from college during the 2020 pandemic, I returned to college in Spring 2021 
                by transferring to Colorado State University. 
                Here, I was introduced to computer science through the Java programming language. I completed a number 
                of introductory CS courses, in which I built solid foundations in both Java and Python. </p>
            <p>In Spring 2023, I moved back to my hometown and transferred to MSU Denver, where I earned a Bachelor of 
                Science in statistics in Spring 2025. </p>
            
            <div class="heading">Employment History</div>
            <p>My most recent formal employment was with a small business in Englewood, CO, which operated an online store 
                selling imported ceramics nationwide. My official position was within the shipping department, in which I was 
                responsible for packaging and shipping online customer orders. </p>
            <p>While I was employed here, I identified a way to drastically improve the receiving process. I offered to create 
                a solution using OCR to scan printed box labels and automatically input the data into an SQL database. If this 
                solution was implemented, it probably would have saved hundreds of hours per week in labor costs, but my 
                proposal was rejected by the owners for reasons unknown to me. </p>
